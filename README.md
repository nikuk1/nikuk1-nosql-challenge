# nikuk1-nosql-challenge

## Description 
This idea was introduced to me by U of A's web development boot camp program.
Base starter code was provided, and I am expected to achieve the expected result.

"Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js (Links to an external site.) and Mongoose (Links to an external site.) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps."_(Source: u of a)
